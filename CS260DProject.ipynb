      "actual_answer:  Statement 1: The intersection of two subgroups of a group is also a subgroup. This statement is true. Let H and K be subgroups of a group G. By definition, a subgroup must contain the identity, so the intersection of H and K also contains the identity. If a and b are in the intersection, then a, b are in both H and K, and so is ab^-1. So the intersection of H and K is closed under the group operation and inverses, and is therefore a subgroup. Statement 2: The union of two subgroups of a group is always a subgroup. This statement is false. The union of two subgroups is not always a subgroup. For example, consider the group of integers Z under addition, and let H = {2n : n ∈ Z} and K = {2n+1 : n ∈ Z} be two subgroups of Z. The union H ∪ K = Z, which is a group, but this is just a special case. If we take H = {0} and K = {2} as subgroups of Z, the union H ∪ K = {0, 2} is not a subgroup of Z, because it is not closed under the operation of addition. The answer is B.\n",
